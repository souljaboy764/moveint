## Data Extraction

- Download the dataset from https://zenodo.org/record/7767535#.ZB2-43bMLIU
- Unzip it to the folder [`data`](data) so that you have the directory structure as "data/Bimanual Handovers Dataset"
- Run [`data_extraction.py`](data_extraction.py)

Some example configurations for testing can be seen in `train.sh`
